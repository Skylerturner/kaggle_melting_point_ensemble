# kaggle_melting_point_ensemble
This is my first project on Kaggle. The competition was to take a data set of organic compounds and predict their melting points. I used an ensemble classification method to separate the compounds into low, medium, and high melting points. I then fed these into different XGBRegressors to predict the final melting point.
